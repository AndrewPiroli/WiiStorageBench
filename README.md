# WiiStorageBench

A fork of WiiXplorer with most of its features removed.

It's designed soley to read files from SD or USB mass storage and record the read speed with no data processing done.

In order to test read speed, browse to a file, use the plus on the Wiimote and select "Benchmark speed", it will read the file showing the speed on screen and will display a result when it is finished.
The file must be at least a few MB or it will read too fast or will be smaller than the read chunk size.

Any crashing are features, not bugs.
